# üå°Ô∏è HAT for STM32F0: Temperature & Humidity Monitoring

# EEE3088F Group Project

Welcome to our **EEE3088F Group Project** repository! This repository contains all the project files for our HAT designed for the STM32F0 microcontroller. The HAT is equipped with a temperature and humidity sensor to monitor external environmental conditions. The HAT allows users to set the range of acceptable temperature and humidity values, and will immediately alert the user if the conditions fall outside of this range. 

## üöÄ Project Overview

The primary functionality of the HAT is to monitor external environmental conditions using an analogue hygrometer and a digital temperature sensor. 

This HAT has a wide range of potential applications. It would be particularly useful in monitoring for satisfactory growth conditions of plants in an agricultural setting. Secondly, the HAT may aid with maintaining optimum food and beverage storage conditions and therein reducing the amount of consumables that perish. Lastly, the HAT may be set to trigger air conditioning units and dehumidifiers in hospitals such that the patients may recuperate in a steady environment. 

## ü§ù Contributors

This project is being developed by three contributors:

- Matt Pettit
- Holly Lewis
- Queto Jenkins

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware

The HAT is designed to attach to the STM32F051C6T6 microcontroller. The board includes circuitry to control power, the ability to be soft programmed and a standard pin interface on which the HAT will connect.
